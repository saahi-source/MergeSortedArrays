# MergeSortedArrays in Java

This project shows how to merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array using Java.

The program compares values from both arrays one at a time and places the smaller value into a new array.

JUnit tests are included to make sure the method works correctly for different cases like:
- normal arrays
- empty arrays
- arrays of different sizes
- arrays with duplicate values

## Files
- MergeSortedArrays.java : contains the method that merges the two arrays
- MergeSortedArraysTest.java : contains test cases using JUnit

## How to Run
1. Open the project in VS Code or any Java IDE.
2. Run the JUnit tests.
